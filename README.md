HealthCare Chatbot Overview
This website features a healthcare chatbot, MyHealthieBot-KangoBot, designed to assist users with a wide range of health-related inquiries. The chatbot offers preliminary advice based on information sourced from reputable, authorized medical websites and is guided by input from university professors and doctors. However, it's important to note that the chatbot's suggestions related to medications and treatments are only recommendations and not definitive medical advice.

This platform is developed using CSS and HTML programming languages, ensuring a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface for an enhanced user experience.
